A Cheminformatics Workflow for Higher-throughput modeling of Chemical Exposures from Biosolids
Paul M. Kruse, Caroline L. Ring
Abstract [<250 words]
To rapidly parameterize and run an exposure model to predict potential human exposures to chemical contaminants in biosolids, large quantities of chemical data are required. We present an R workflow that uses publicly available databases to prepare data for BST simulations. This cheminformatics workflow demonstrates the power of leveraging publicly-accessible chemical data for rapid model parameterization and chemical prioritization.
Introduction [<750]
The Clean Water Act requires the US EPA to identify pollutants in biosolids and propose regulations to manage such pollutants, as well as review regulations for the purpose of identifying additional toxic pollutants. Based on existing biosolids monitoring data, 726 chemical contaminants have been identified with presence in biosolids, as the result of a 2022 data curation [1]. The US EPA Office of Water (OW) would like to prioritize these chemicals according to their potential risk to human health and the environment.
Potential risk from chemical contaminants in biosolids is estimated by considering both exposure (how much contact a human, animal, or plant has with the chemical resulting from biosolids contamination) and hazard/toxicity (the capability of the chemical to cause adverse effects, and the exposure level at which such adverse effects may occur). Biosolids-specific exposure models have been implemented in the publicly-available Biosolids Screening Tool (BST) [5]. The BST predicts exposures associated with land application of biosolids in agricultural and land reclamation settings or placement in a surface disposal unit, under scenarios of three different climate types (wet, average, and dry). 
The BST can be run only for chemicals with known concentrations in biosolids. Of the 726 chemical contaminants with known presence in biosolids, 484 have measured, quantitative concentrations in biosolids from one of the three National Sewage Sludge Surveys (NSSS), which measured chemical contaminant concentrations in samples of sewage sludge from a representative sample of wastewater treatment plants across the United States {Richman, 2022 #130}{Richman, 2022 #182}. 
Materials and Methods [no word limit]
In order to run the BST for these 484 chemicals with biosolids concentration data, physico-chemical properties are required for the model to predict chemical fate and transport among various environmental media. Additional chemical data may also optionally be supplied to the BST for more-detailed modeling of chemical fate and transport (Table 1 and Table 2). Detailed information about the required chemical-specific data, and how they are used in the equations of the BST models, may be found in the BST User Guide Appendices {United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2023 #107}.
The BST is implemented as a Microsoft Access tool, in which chemical-specific parameters may be entered manually, one chemical at a time, using a pre-programmed graphical interface. Once all necessary parameters for a chemical are entered into the BST, then the BST may be run for that chemical. Required chemical-specific data are pre-loaded into the BST for 77 chemical substances, but for other chemical substances, they must be added by the user. 
To speed up the process of adding new chemicals to the BST, a bulk upload functionality has been implemented: using a specially-formatted Microsoft Excel workbook, the user may enter chemical-specific data in tabular form for multiple chemicals, and import this data into the BST. Whether the graphical interface or the bulk upload functionality is used, the user is responsible for determining values for chemical-specific parameters before entering them into the BST, for example by searching public databases or the peer-reviewed literature. The user is also responsible for keeping track of the sources of any chemical-specific parameter values. 
However, with more than 400 chemicals to consider, gathering parameter values one chemical at a time was not feasible. Here, we describe an automated, reproducible workflow to parameterize the BST. 
Most of the chemical-specific parameters required by the BST to run simulations are available from the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard (CCD), developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency: a web application that integrates publicly-available cheminformatics data from multiple domains and makes these data publicly accessible [4]. CCD developers in the US EPA Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) recently introduced an Application Programming Interface (API) to allow programmatic access to the data available through the CCD. To make it easier for researchers to access the CCD data they need, we have developed an R package to make using the Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CTX) API as easy as writing a single line of R code. This is the ctxR package, which allows researchers to integrate the CTX APIs directly into an R-based automated data workflow, without having to know how to construct API calls or how to parse the data returned from an API call [6]. ctxR is implemented as a free, open-source, publicly available R package. ctxR can be downloaded in its latest development state from GitHub at https://github.com/USEPA/ctxR or in the latest stable release state from CRAN at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ctxR. 
The automated BST workflow is designed to take as input a list of chemical identifiers for which biosolids-related exposure calculations are desired, and to produce as output a properly-formatted Microsoft Excel spreadsheet containing the required chemical-specific parameters to run the BST for each chemical identifier in the input list.
The format of the output Excel spreadsheet is defined by the Bulk Upload Tool. This tool, developed by RTI, consists of an Excel workbook that prescribes a special tabular format for user-input chemical-specific data so that the Microsoft-Access-based BST can import it automatically. The Bulk Upload Tool contains three  import  sheets on which the user must enter tabular chemical data: one sheet listing the chemical identifiers to be imported; one sheet for the chemical-specific parameters; and one sheet for ecological inputs. The chemical-specific parameter import sheet is organized in a table with columns for the chemical identifier; the name of the BST parameter; the value of the BST parameter; and a reference identifier that identifies the source of the value. This is the required format for the output of the BST Workflow.
The Bulk Upload Tool prescribes not only the format, but also the content, of the BST Workflow output. Each chemical must have a valid numeric value listed for every parameter expected by the BST. There are different lists of required parameters depending on whether the input chemical is organic or inorganic. The Bulk Upload Tool lists the required chemical-specific parameters in tabular form on two  template  sheets, one for organic chemicals and one for inorganic chemicals. There is also a third  template  sheet for ecological parameters, for which the same list is required for both organic and inorganic chemicals. The  template  sheets also specify the acceptable range of values for each parameter. 
These requirements are strict. Chemicals with incomplete or out-of-range data cannot be bulk-uploaded at all. If, for any chemical, any of the required parameters are not present in the table, or have values outside of the accepted range, then either the bulk-upload process or the BST simulations will fail with an error. In addition, chemicals with data already present in the BST cannot be bulk-uploaded. Supplying new data for these chemicals in the Bulk Upload Tool will not overwrite the existing data, nor will it create a duplicate chemical; instead, the bulk-upload process or the BST simulations will fail with an error.  
The BST Workflow, in effect, fills out the appropriate  template  tables for each input chemical (chemical-specific and ecological tables). 
The steps of the BST Workflow are summarized in the following list and described in more detail below.
1. Load list of chemical identifiers of interest. 
2. Load chemical classifications:  inorganic  or  organic.  Chemicals or substances that cannot be classified as either  inorganic  or  organic  are excluded from further analysis. 
3. Identify chemicals that are dioxin-like. These are excluded from BST exposure modeling, as EPA has previously made a regulatory determination about DLCs in biosolids.
4. Identify chemicals whose parameters are already loaded into the BST. 
5. Load a list of the BST s required chemical-specific parameters, depending on whether the chemical is organic or inorganic.
6. Populate required physical-chemical property data by querying EPA databases using ctxR.
7. Populate required biotransfer factors from pre-existing tables, or predict them from physical-chemical properties using equations as implemented in the BST.
8. Populate required ecological data using placeholder values (such data are sparse and non-zero values must be input to produce non-zero predictions).
9. Check that all necessary data are supplied, rejecting chemicals missing any such data.
10. Check that all supplied values are within acceptable operating ranges for the BST.  
a. If discrepancy is small, adjust to the exceeded limit.
b. If discrepancy is large, reject chemical.
11. Combine accepted data into tables and output into a correctly-formatted format .xlsx file.
In step 1, the chemical identifiers of interest should be DSSTox Substance IDs (DTXSIDs). These are unique identifiers for substances in EPA s Distributed Searchable Substance-Toxicity database [7]. Other chemical identifiers, such as Chemical Abstract Service Registry Numbers (CASRNs), chemical names, or InChIKeys, should be mapped to DTXSIDs before beginning the workflow. This mapping can be achieved using ctxR functions ctxR::chemical_equal(), ctxR::chemical_starts_with(), or ctxR::chemical_contains(), which search the CCD for chemical identifier strings (including full or partial name, CASRN, or InChIKey) and return matching DTXSIDs.
In step 2, the chemical classifications  inorganic  and  organic  are assigned automatically using the ClassyFire chemical classification tool, which classifies chemicals based on their structure using the ChemOnt ontology [8]. ClassyFire provides a hierarchical chemical classification with levels kingdom, superclass, class, subclass, and up to seven additional levels (levels 5 through 11). At present, the ClassyFire tool available on the web can be queried by supplying the chemical s InChIKey, which identifies its structure. Chemical identifiers such as DTXSIDs can be mapped to InChIKeys using the CTX APIs described above. If the chemical does not have an InChIKey, or if ClassyFire does not return a classification of  inorganic  or  organic , then the chemical is marked as being of unknown or variable composition, complex reaction product, or biological material (UVCB), and excluded from further analysis.
In step 3, dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) are identified using their ClassyFire classifications: if their class is either  Benzodioxins  or  Benzofurans,  or their level-6 classification is  Polychlorinated biphenyls,  then they are designated DLCs and excluded from further analysis.  DLCs are excluded from BST exposure modeling, as the BST exposure models cannot produce reliable predictions for this class of chemicals and limits on dioxin-like compounds in biosolids have previously been established.
In step 4, the known list of 77 chemicals already loaded into the BST is provided and chemical identifiers are compared to this list.
In step 5, the chemical-specific parameters required to run the BST are different depending on whether the chemical is organic (Table 1) or inorganic (Table 2). CAS, ChemicalName, and CTPWasteDry are inputs supplied by the user. CTPWasteDry is the user-supplied chemical concentration in biosolids. CAS and ChemicalName are chemical identifiers used by the BST. If not user-supplied, they can be acquired from the DTXSID by querying CTX databases using the R package ctxR (described above) with the function ctxR::get_chemical_details(). 
Values for each subset of these parameters are determined based on the following methods.
Physical-chemical properties
Molecular weight MW, octanol-water partition coefficient log Kow, Henry s Law Constant HLC, water solubility Sol, and organic-carbon partition coefficient Koc are all acquired from the DTXSID by querying the CCD using ctxR as described above. MW is queried using function ctxR::get_chemical_details(); the other properties are queried using function ctxR::get_chem_info(); if Koc is not available using the previous functions, then it is queried using function ctxR::get_fate_by_dtxsid(). 
The CCD includes both experimental and QSAR-predicted values for these properties. If experimental values are available, then they are used. (If more than one experimental value is available for a property, then the average is taken.) If no experimental values are available for one of these properties, then QSAR-predicted values are used. (If more than one QSAR-predicted value is available for a property, then the average is taken.) 
For MW, log Kow, HLC, and Sol, if neither experimental nor QSAR-predicted values are available, then the value is assigned as NA (Not Available). 
For Koc, if neither experimental nor QSAR-predicted values are available, then the value is predicted using an equation that estimates Koc based on chemical ionization at pH 7.0, pKa, pKb, and log Kow. This equation is the same one implemented in the well-established wastewater treatment fugacity model SimpleTreat 4.0 [9]. The chemical ionization at pH 7.0 is determined using the method and physicochemical data implemented in the R package httk (function httk::calc_ionization()) [10]. The pKa value is predicted by the OPEn structure activity/property Relationship App (OPERA) QSAR [11].
For Kd (the soil partition coefficient), used only for inorganic chemicals, chemical-specific data are extremely limited. In the absence of chemical-specific data, we use a constant value of 1 105, reflecting the conservative assumption that all of the chemical binds to the solid component of sewage sludge and will not wash out. 
Air and water diffusivity constants are estimated using methods developed by Tucker and Nelken [12]. Air diffusivity constant Da is predicted based on temperature (assumed to be 25 degrees Celsius), pressure (assumed to be 1 atm), the molecular weights of air and the chemical of interest, and the diffusion volume (molar volume) of air and the chemical of interest. The molecular weight of air is assumed to be approximately 28.97 g/mol, and the diffusion volume of air is assumed to be approximately 20.1 cm3/mol. Water diffusivity constant Dw is predicted based on the viscosity of water (assumed to be 0.8904 mPa-s) and the LaBas estimate of diffusion volume of the chemical of interest. We substitute the molar volume for the diffusion volume (or its LaBas estimate). The molar volume of the chemical of interest is determined by querying CTX databases: if experimental values are available, they are used; otherwise, predicted values are used if available; if neither are available, then the molar volume and therefore the Da and Dw are assigned as NA.
Biotransfer factors
Bioconcentration factors (BCFs) for beef, milk, and plants are predicted from log Kow for each chemical, using equations originally implemented in the BST (see BST User s Guide, Appendix C) [13]. A single soil-to-plant BCF is used for all aboveground vegetation (all plant BCFs except for root vegetables), and a root concentration factor is calculated for root vegetables. The air-to-leaf biotransfer factor is calculated from log Kow and Henry s Law constant for organic chemicals, but is set to 0 for inorganic chemicals, following the assumptions of the BST. If log Kow is NA (not available), then BCFs are all set to NA as well. If the Henry s Law constant is NA, then the air-to-leaf biotransfer factor is set to NA as well.
Fish bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) are drawn from the National Bioaccumulation Factor (NBAF) tables when available [14]. If no values are available from the NBAF tables for Tier 3, Tier 4, or both, then the missing value(s) are gap-filled by using CTX APIs to query the CCD for bioconcentration factor values available under the  Fate  endpoint, which may include measured values from the ECOTOX database {Olker, 2022 #199} and/or QSAR-predicted values from OPERA {Mansouri, 2018 #25}. In this case, if one or more measured aquatic BCF values are available from the ECOTOX database, then the geometric mean of available values will be used; if no measured values are available, but one or more OPERA-predicted values are available, then the geometric mean of those values will be used. Any fish BAFs with no values available from any of these sources are assigned as NA.

Ecological data
At present, all ecological BAFs/BCFs and ecological toxicity values are assigned placeholder values of 1. These placeholder values allow all BST simulations to run, but the resulting estimates of ecological exposure and risk are not meaningful and are not used in this case study. Placeholder ecological values are used because the goal of the present BST simulations was to predict biosolids-specific human exposures. However, functionality to format and populate the required table of ecological data was built into the BST Workflow to facilitate future modeling efforts that may include simulation of ecological exposures. 
Check for missing data
In step 9, the workflow checks for missing data. The BST will not run if any chemicals are missing one or more required parameters. There are helper functions in the workflow that determine which information is missing for each chemical on each type of BST input sheet: organic, inorganic, and ecological. If nothing is missing, the functions return a NULL value, but if there are missing data, then a data frame is populated for each chemical with the names of the pieces of data that are missing. This data frame can be saved as an additional output of the BST Workflow.  
Check for data within BST operating range
In step 10, the workflow checks whether chemical data are within the BST s pre-specified operating ranges (see Table 1 and Table 2 for ranges). Similarly, there are helper functions for organic and inorganic chemicals that check to see whether input data fall within the operating range for the BST. These take in a data frame of physico-chemical property data and check that each input value is within the range of allowable values. If the values exceed the maximum value or are below the minimum value (for non-zero lower bounds), the function tests whether the difference is greater than 1% of the violated bound. If so, the property name is recorded, and if not, the property value is set to the value of the boundary it has exceeded. For lower bounds of zero, the values are not set to zero and instead recorded as out of bounds.
Export correctly-formatted spreadsheets
In step 11, the BST workflow generates a list of data frames, where each list item corresponds to one of the required sheets in the Bulk Upload Tool. This list can be written to an Excel workbook using the `writexl` package, function `writexl::write_xlsx()`.
To use the Bulk Upload functionality, this workbook must be saved with the filename  ChemicalImport.xlsx  in the same directory as the BST .mdb file. Then, the user can open the BST, click the  Configure  button, go to the  Chemicals  tab, and click the  Bulk Import Chemicals  button. Without any further confirmation or interaction required from the user, all the chemicals in the prepared Excel workbook will be imported to the BST, and will appear as new items on the Chemicals tab.
After the bulk upload is complete, the workbook may be renamed to anything the user wants. 
The bulk-upload process has limitations that are inherent to the BST Access implementation. Once uploaded, chemicals cannot be bulk-deleted from the BST. If you want to remove chemicals, they must be deleted manually, one at a time. Also, once uploaded, chemicals cannot be bulk-overwritten. For example, if you make a change to the BST Workflow that affects a parameter value for all chemicals, you cannot bulk-re-upload the chemicals and overwrite their data to reflect the change you made. For this reason, we recommend keeping a  clean  version of the BST .mdb file, containing only the default preloaded chemicals. When you want to bulk-upload chemicals, first create a copy of the .mdb file, and save it with a different name. Then open your new copy of the BST and bulk-upload chemicals to that copy. If you need to make a change to the BST Workflow and re-upload chemicals, you can go back to the  clean  version, make a new copy, and start again.
Case study
To demonstrate the use of the BST Workflow, we ran it for the curated list of 727 chemicals that have been detected in biosolids, available in {Richman, 2022 #182@@author-year}. For biosolids concentrations of these chemicals, we considered both the mean and 95th percentile concentrations reported from the most recent available National Sewage Sludge Survey (calculated with non-detects set equal to half of the Minimum Reporting Limit), as found in {Richman, 2022 #182@@author-year}, If a chemical on the curated biosolids list was not monitored in any NSSS, or if it was monitored but was not detected in a sufficient number of samples to calculate a mean concentration, then it was excluded from further analysis. We additionally considered a third scenario where biosolids concentrations were set equal to 1 ppb for all chemicals, which provides a relative ranking of potential for exposure, including chemicals with no available NSSS concentration data.
Pre-loaded BST chemicals cannot be edited or overwritten using the BST Workflow, so they were edited manually. All pre-loaded chemicals were manually edited within the BST to set their reference dose (RfD) values equal to 1, the same as for the BST Workflow. Pre-loaded chemicals were also manually edited to set their biosolids concentration (CTPWasteDry) equal to the appropriate concentration: the most recent NSSS mean concentration, the most recent NSSS 95th percentile concentration, or 1 ppb (1   10-3 mg/kg dry weight). Pre-loaded chemicals not present on the curated biosolids list were excluded from analysis: this excluded Chromium (III), Chromium (VI), Mercury (divalent), Selenium (IV), and Selenium (VI). Pre-loaded chemicals present on the curated biosolids list, but with no NSSS mean concentration data available, were also excluded from analysis: this excluded Albuterol, Chlortetracycline, Oxolinic acid, PFOA, PFOS, and Sulfathiazole. 
The BST was run under three land application scenarios (Crop, Pasture, and Reclamation), assuming an average climate (as opposed to dry or wet climate). Other than the chemical-specific parameters, all other parameters of the BST were left at their default values; see the BST User Guide for details {United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2023 #107@@author-year}. 
The BST simulation results were saved as an Excel workbook and then imported into R using the `readxl::read_excel()` function. The chemicals were ranked according to the BST-predicted average daily dose through the oral (ingestion) pathway for an adult farmer. 
Results
 From inputting the list of chemicals at the start to generating the bulk upload file at the end, the entire BST Workflow process took approximately 15 minutes on a Dell laptop with 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1365U 1.80 GHz processor and 16 gigabytes of RAM. BST simulations took roughly 30 hours to complete.
Out of the 727 chemicals on the curated biosolids list, the BST was able to make exposure predictions for 241. The data filtering steps are illustrated in Figure 1. 68 chemicals were pre-loaded into the BST, and therefore were excluded from further BST Workflow filtering steps. 257 chemicals were excluded because they could not be classified as either organic or inorganic. 222 more chemicals were excluded because they were DLCs. Three more chemicals were excluded because their LogKow values were more than 1% greater than the high end of the BST operating range (i.e., 12). Four more chemicals were excluded because they are known to trigger an unknown bug in the BST. This left 173 chemicals to be uploaded using the Bulk Upload Tool. Combined with the 68 pre-loaded chemicals, the BST was able to make exposure predictions for 241 total chemicals.

The flow proceeds from left to right across the stages that are labeled along the bottom.  is_BST_preload : whether the DTXSID corresponds to a CASRN already in the BST.  chemical_class : Is the chemical organic, inorganic, or other (usually UVCB).  is_DLC2 : Whether the chemical is dioxin-like or not.  missing_data : Whether the chemical is still missing values for any of the required BST parameters after the hierarchical process described in the main text.  out_of_range_high  and  out_of_range_low : Whether any of the required BST parameter values were more than 1% out of range on the high or low end, respectively.  bad_format : Whether the DTXSID is on the list of chemicals that crash the BST for unknown reasons.  Bulk_Upload : whether chemical info is to be imported using the Bulk Upload Tool (chemicals which passed all previous stages).  is_run : whether the chemical is included in BST simulation runs (the combination of bulk-uploaded chemical and preloaded chemicals).
When biosolids concentration data availability from the NSSS was also considered, the BST was only able to make predictions for 231 chemicals (Figure 2); ten chemicals not otherwise excluded had neither mean nor 95th percentile concentration values available from the NSSS.

Figure 2. Sankey diagram of data filtering steps for 727 DTXSIDs in the curated list of chemicals detected in biosolids. As for Figure 1, but Includes an additional data filtering step at the beginning: whether chemicals have mean or 95th percentile concentration values in the NSSS.
The Bulk Upload worksheets produced by the BST Workflow are provided in Supplemental Tables 1-3. The output of the Biosolids Screening Tool is provided in Supplemental Tables 4-6. BST-predicted oral average daily doses (ADD) for an adult farmer spanned a wide range of values, approximately 1   10-10   1   103 mg/kg/day for simulations made using NSSS mean and 95th percentile concentrations (Figure 3). 
Chemicals were ranked by BST-predicted oral average daily dose (ADD) for an adult farmer, under each of the three land-application use (LAU) scenarios, for each biosolids concentration considered (NSSS mean, NSSS 95th percentile, and 1 ppb) (Supplemental Table 7). For BST predictions based on NSSS mean biosolids concentrations, the top-ranked chemicals by adult farmer ADD primarily included sterols, such as Coprosterol, (3alpha,5beta)-Cholestan-3-ol, (+)-Dihydrocholesterol, Cholesterol, (-)-beta-Sitosterol, Stigmasterol, Squalene, Stigmastan-3beta-ol, and Campesterol, along with elements such as calcium, iron, and magnesium. These substances were among those with the highest NSSS mean biosolids concentrations. Sterols occur naturally in animal feces as the end product of cholesterol metabolism, and tend to be persistent in the environment   in fact, they are often used as a biomarker to detect human or animal fecal contamination of water {Fulke, 2025 #201}   so their occurrence at high levels in biosolids is not unexpected, nor is the potential for higher exposures.
For BST predictions based on NSSS 95th percentile biosolids concentration, the top-ranked chemicals by adult farmer ADD was a slightly different list, including calcium, iron, magnesium, nitrate, and nitrite; squalene and (-)-beta-Sitosterol; dimethyl pthalate; and alkanes such as n-tetracosane, docosane, and eicosane. Interestingly, the alkanes were not among the top-ranked chemicals by NSSS 95th percentile biosolids concentration. In general, NSSS biosolids concentration explained about half of variability in predicted adult ADD on a log10-log10 scale (Figure 4). While  biosolids occurrence is an important driver of potential exposure, it is not the whole story.

Each circle represents one substance. Gray lines represent best-fit linear regression line for each panel (note log10-log10 scale). R2 for each linear regression is shown in upper left corner of each panel.
Discussion [<1500 words]
The BST Workflow is an automated, transparent, reproducible workflow using information from publicly-available cheminformatics databases. This workflow is already in active use by the US EPA Office of Water to prioritize hundreds of biosolids chemical contaminants. The data collection and internal checks in the case of the BST are rapid and thus lend themselves to higher-throughput analysis. We presented an example case study wherein the BST Workflow was used to parameterize the BST for hundreds of chemicals with existing biosolids monitoring data from National Sewage Sludge Surveys. However, the BST Workflow is not limited to use with the chemical list included in this case study. Because of its modular, programmatic structure and its integration of chemical data APIs, the BST Workflow can be applied   with little or no modification   to parametrize and run the BST to predict exposures for new chemicals as additional biosolids monitoring data become available, for example through the biennial review process required under the Clean Water Act. Moreover, with active and predictable development of the CCD, more chemical-specific data will become available; because the BST Workflow consists of R scripts, it can be easily re-run to parameterize the BST with the most up-to-date chemical information. 
In the case study presented here, the BST was used to predict average oral daily doses resulting from land applications of biosolids. However, potential for exposure does not necessarily imply potential for hazard or risk. To predict non-cancer hazard and cancer risk for humans, as well as risks for ecological receptors, the BST includes the capability to compare predicted exposures to user-provided toxicity reference values. While selection of the most appropriate toxicity reference values is beyond the scope of the BST Workflow in its current state, the BST Workflow could easily be extended to automate the process of selecting reference values by drawing on publicly-available databases of toxicity and hazard information such as ToxValDB {Judson, 2018 #139}.

[KP(1]Is this supposed to be a semicolon?
[CR2R1]No, I think a colon is correct here, because it is being used to introduce an explanation.
[KP(3]Should we write this is logKow or logK _{OW} (subscripted)?
[CR4R3]Since we re listing parameter names as defined in the BST, I would not use subscripts. (If we were referring to the general concept of octanol-water partition coefficient, then yes, I would use subscripts.)
[CR5]Did we end up using these eco exposures for anything or not? The previous sentence says we did, but this sentence says we didn t.
[KP(6]Be sure to run benchmark simulations of say 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 chemicals to determine runtime complexity as it relates to the length of chemicals. It would be good to do this for all organic and all inorganic. Any mixture or organic and inorganic will be a convex combination of associated runtimes.
